# Accessing the Ravelry API with Python

This is Python code to help someone get started using the Ravelry API, or any API.

See https://medium.com/data-science-at-microsoft/how-to-access-an-api-for-first-time-api-users-879002f5f58d?source=friends_link&sk=c2763957800727392111bfe47da08fb3 for my article describing APIs and more information about the code.

## How to use

To adopt for your own use, note you need to store your Ravelry keys in `config.py` as
```
authUsername = 'your username'
authPassword = 'your pass'
```

You can generate your keys at [Ravelry.com/api](ravelry.com/api).
